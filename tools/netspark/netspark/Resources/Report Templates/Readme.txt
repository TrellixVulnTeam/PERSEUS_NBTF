This folder is scanned by Netsparker in every launch. All files with ".cshtml" extension in here will be visible in the "Reporting" menu.

DO NOT COPY template reports unless you TRUST them, they've got code execution privilege and the code will be executed as Netsparker process's user's privileges.

You can write your own report templates by using C# scripting. Take a look at already written examples and "Netsparker Reporting API" documentation for further information.
